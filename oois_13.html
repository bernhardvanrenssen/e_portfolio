                        <p><strong>A summary of the reflections on each activity/assignment completed in this Module:</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>Unit 1 - 3: Collaborative discussion:</strong></p>
                        <p>Starting off this module, the first activity was a collaborative discussion on the failure of an information system, and the implications thereof. 
                            It was very informative on how Test Driven Design (TDD) is important in implementing any software systems as a possibility to iron out any major 
                            bugs on deployment. </p>

                        <p><strong>Unit 3: Codio exercises</strong></p>
                        <p>With our first introduction to Object Oriented Programming in this module, I initially had a hard time understanding why object-oriented design 
                            was developed in the first place, and what it is used for. Having worked through the exercises, this hands-on approach slowly but steadily made 
                            me realize how useful OOP can be, and what value it brings in system design. </p>

                        <p><strong>Unit 3-5: UML Diagram</strong></p>
                        <p>After reading on how code is planned out as UML diagrams, this unit’s activity provided a chance to design a UML Class diagram for an Online 
                            Supermarket. The first attempt at creating these classes was very challenging, and the example I designed was a way too complex, with many 
                            errors (example using wrong arrowhead types, using inheritance where I should not have amongst other things). The Seminar on this topic provided 
                            very useful afterwards, as I learned a lot, especially regarding using Inheritance, Aggregation and Composition in Class design.</p>

                        <p><strong>Unit 6: Seminar Preparation on UML</strong></p>
                        <p>Spending another few weeks on UML gave me more time to grasp a better understanding on how to build systems in a simpler and more effective way. 
                            Unit 6 gave me another opportunity to design a UML Class diagram, and having a better grasp on inheritance, aggregation and composition, I felt 
                            more comfortable designing a UML diagram for a doctors office. I also had a first attempt on a UML sequence diagram this week – and based on the 
                            feedback from the lecturer, had some more practicing and learning to do on other types of UML diagrams.</p>

                        <p><strong>Unit 7: Normalization in Practice</strong></p>
                        <p>Week 7 introduced a complete new topic, storing data in tables by means of SQL databases. Although the previous module briefly introduced us to SQL 
                            and some basic SQL functions, this unit got into more detail on how to design tables to store data in, and the importance of Normalization of data. 
                            A tricky unit for me, as I had to do quite some extensive external reading and learning on how data Normalization works, as well as the concepts of 
                            UNF, 1NF, 2NF and 3NF. </p>

                        <p><strong>Unit 7: Mid-Module Summative Assignment: System Design</strong></p>
                        <p>This was the first Summative assessment – an exercise on designing a complete UML Class diagram to manage a Self-Service checkout supermarket. 
                            By now I had more practice and confidence in UML Class diagram design, and could quickly generate solutions for the problems with ease. Sticking 
                            strictly with the brief, I designed the required system by first identifying the class types, then identifying relationships, and finally filling 
                            in the class attributes and definitions for the system to work properly. The assignment went well, and I received a distinction for my efforts.</p>

                        <p><strong>Unit 8 – 10: Collaborative discussion 2: SQL vs NoSQL</strong></p>
                        <p>The 2nd collaborative discussion allowed us to do our own research (on top of the study material provided) on the working and differences of SQL 
                            databases vs NoSQL databases. This was very informative, and gave me the chance to learn how different types of data is stored – especially relevant 
                            to large systems found in today’s world where different data types need to be retrieved fast. </p>

                        <p><strong>Unit 10: Codio</strong></p>
                        <p>This Unit allowed us to continue practicing and learning how to implement and use SQL in an Object-Oriented way, as well as some more advanced 
                            exercises on Python OOP. Some exercises were particularly difficult and required some thinking and reading-up. I enjoyed the challenge.</p>

                        <p><strong>Unit 11: Flask</strong></p>
                        <p>After learning of web development, this unit provide us with material to build our own Flask web application. I completed the flask tutorial on 
                            building a web-hosted blog site, which is hosted in my github repository. A challenging exercise, with a steep learning curve. </p>

                        <p><strong>Unit 11: System Implementation</strong></p>
                        <p>Our second-to-last assignment was to build and implement a designed system. A UML Class diagram was provided on which I had to build a working 
                            application, using an object-oriented approach using Python. After initially struggling with limitations such as not being able to use a SQL 
                            database, and having to build the system in an older version of Python (2.7), if turned out to be a useful exercise on how to implement a system 
                            that has been designed by an architect. A lengthy project that took me longer than I thought, but valuable information gained by having to work 
                            through unexpected outcomes and issues that this project brought forward.</p>

                        <p><strong>Overall Reflection and comments on this module</strong></p>
                        <p>Looking at the assignment from the previous module – Launching into Computer Science – where we had to build a program that keeps track of personal 
                            entries (not in OOP), I can see major strides in my growth as a software developer. Learning to implement and use classes provide major advantages 
                            over simply functional programming. </p>
                        <p>Having had plenty of practice on UML design (a concept that was previously foreign to me), provided me with new and useful tools on how to structure 
                            and plan any code before simply jumping into the coding process. In retrospect, I can see how I made major strides in improving each attempt, 
                            and even got to a distinction on the mid-module assignment for class diagrams</p>

                        <p>Observing all my coding exercises in this module, I can clearly see a more structured and organized code than before, and have picked-up valuable 
                            skills throughout this module, in UML, Python, SQL, Flask and informed collaborative discussions.</p>
